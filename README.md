# Car Racing
## 1.0 Introduction
For this exercise, we collected data from the openai gym ‚ÄúCarRacing-v0‚Äù gaming interface. This was done by playing the game various times. The data includes the following:
* State ‚Äì 96 x 96 pixel RGB image of each frame
* Action ‚Äì three element vector denoting the set of actions taken corresponding to the frame 

Below is an example of the data collected. Note that the action associate with the frame is [-1, 0, 0] which denotes LEFT.

## 1.1 Data Processing

Given that actions are velocity dependent, we would like to restructure the for of the data such that the network has some signal of the velocity. This was done by first turning the images to grayscale, then stacking the past 5 frames to form a 5 x 96 x 96 rank 3 tensor. Below is an example of the input tensor.

We also made some modifications to the form of the target variable, the action. It is given by a two-element vector [steer, accelerate] such that
* steer = {‚ÄúNOTHING‚Äù: 0, ‚ÄúLEFT‚Äù: 1, ‚ÄúRIGHT‚Äù, 2}
* accelerate = {‚ÄúNOTHING‚Äù: 0, ‚ÄúACCELERATE‚Äù: 1, ‚ÄúBRAKE‚Äù: 2}

## 1.2 Network Architecture

Our neural network starts with a CNN network to extract visual / temporal features, followed by two subnetworks each consisting of a two layer fully connected network. The first and second subnetwork is dedicated to predicting the probability of each component steer and accelerate respectively.

## 1.3 Loss Function

The loss function is given by the weighted addition of two cross-entropy loss evaluated following each subnetwork and is expressed as follows

L = L<sub>steer</sub> + ùúÜ L<sub>accelerate</sub>

where L, L<sub>steer</sub>, and L<sub>accelerate</sub> is the total loss, cross-entropy loss for the steer subnetwork, and the cross-entropy loss for the accelerate subnetwork. ùúÜ is a scaling factor which is set empirically to ensure each component of the loss are of similar scale. Based on our observations, ùúÜ=1.0 yields comparable scales between the steering and acceleration loss components.

## 1.4 Training 

We evaluated the impact of training set size on performance by assessing the validation loss, accuracy, and agent 10 episode average score at different training set size values. Note that as the training set size increases, the accuracy increases while the loss decreases as expected. The agent score over training set size also show a similar trend.

## 1.5 Lessons Learned

1. In training the agent, we utilized the learning rate finder method described in [L. Smith. Cyclic Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.01186, 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) to find an appropriate learning rate. Below is an example figure of the learning rate finder process. The point at which the training loss decreases at the highest rate yields an appropriate learning rate.

2. In our initial iteration of the model, we used one hot encoded discrete actions such that the network can only output one action at each time step. This approach did not prove to work as it did not allow for the complex action scheme required during a sharp turn in which both breaking and steering is required in unison. We therefore

3. The final CNN network used consists of four convolutional layers each made up of a stride 2 same padded convolution followed by ReLU and batch normalization functions. The first convolution layer applies a 5x5 kernel to yield a larger receptive field. All other convolution layers apply a 3x3 kernel. By trial an error, this form of architecture yields the best results. Furthermore, the addition of the batch normalization layer seems to help speed up training and improves training stability. 

4. We tried to pool data across multiple students to yield a larger training set. The large size of the data made it difficult to lead everything into memory at once. We therefore save each frame as a png image and modified the __getitem__ method of the Dataset class such that each frame is processed upon being indexed. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were not able to complete this implementation approach. One interesting finding from pursuing this approach was that the selecting the appropriate image format is critical for training particularly at such low resolutions. The figure below depicts the difference between the original state extracted from the openai gym framework, a png version of the state, and a jpg version. Due to the image compression, jpg format yields a blurry image which hinders the training process.

5. We tried to use a resnet18 pretrained network as the CNN network to extract visual features. Unfortunately, the use of the pretrained network limits us to using a single rgb hence doesn‚Äôt allow for the extraction of temporal features. We therefore decided to develop a custom network which allows for a five-channel input.
